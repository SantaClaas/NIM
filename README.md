The project consists of a .NET Standard 2.0 library containing the game logic, a Blazor component shared library for ui logic and elements for both the client and serverside projects.  
It is written in C# using ASP.NET Core 3 with serverside Blazor and preview versions of .Net Core 3.1 for the Clientside Blazor WebAssembly project
